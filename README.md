Project for High School Precalculus class from the Spring of 2015. The task was, given a map of a college campus with dorm locations and populations marked, to find the optimum location for a hot dog stand. I made a computer simulation of the campus, using LWJGL and Slick2D for TileMap and Pathfinding engines because I procrastinated, and only had about 6 hours to make this. map.txt provides the tile map, on which paths are denoted by "1" and empty space by "0." A set number of students are spawned at coordinates representing the locations of the dorms. Each student is given a destination of another dorm (or a random spot on the path, configured in the Student class), and the A* pathfinder takes them there. An array that acts as a heatmap tracks how many students passed each coordinate point. The point with the most traffic is crowned the optimum location. Look at campus.jpg and map.txt for visuals of the campus.
